This library implements the Partially Created Zcash Transaction (PCZT) format.
This format enables splitting up the logical steps of creating a Zcash transaction
across distinct entities. The entity roles roughly match those specified in
[BIP 174: Partially Signed Bitcoin Transaction Format] and [BIP 370: PSBT Version 2],
with additional Zcash-specific roles.

[BIP 370: PSBT Version 2]: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0370.mediawiki
