//! Zaino's core mempool and chain-fetching Library.
//!
//! Built to use a configurable backend, current and planned backend options:
//! - FetchService (WIP - Functionality complete, requires local compact block cache for efficiency).
//!    - Built using the Zcash Json RPC Services for backwards compatibility with Zcashd and other JsonRPC based validators.
//! - StateService (WIP)
//!    - Built using Zebra's ReadStateService for efficient chain access.
//! - TonicService (PLANNED)
//! - DarksideService (PLANNED)
