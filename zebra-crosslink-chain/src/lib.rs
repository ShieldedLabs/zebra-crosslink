//! Core Zcash Crosslink data structures
//!
//! This crate deals only with in-memory state validation and excludes I/O, tokio, services, etc...
//!
//! This crate is named similarly to [zebra_chain] since it has a similar scope. In a mature crosslink-enabled Zebra these two crates may be merged.

/// The BFT block content for Crosslink
///
/// # Constructing [BftPayload]s
///
/// A [BftPayload] may be constructed from a node's local view in order to create a new BFT proposal, or they may be constructed from unknown sources across a network protocol.
///
/// To construct a [BftPayload] for a new BFT proposal, build a [Vec] of [BcBlockHeader] values, starting from the latest known PoW tip and traversing back in time (following [previous_block_hash](BcBlockHeader::previous_block_hash)) until exactly [bc_confirmation_depth_sigma](ZcashCrosslinkParameters::bc_confirmation_depth_sigma) headers are collected, then pass this to [BftPayload::try_from].
///
/// To construct from an untrusted source, call the same [BftPayload::try_from].
///
/// ## Validation and Limitations
///
/// The [BftPayload::try_from] method is the only way to construct [BftPayload] values and performs the following validation internally:
///
/// 1. The number of headers matches the expected protocol confirmation depth, [bc_confirmation_depth_sigma](ZcashCrosslinkParameters::bc_confirmation_depth_sigma).
/// 2. The [version](BcBlockHeader::version) field is a known expected value.
/// 3. The headers are in the correct order given the [previous_block_hash](BcBlockHeader::previous_block_hash) fields.
/// 4. The PoW solutions validate.
///
/// These validations use *immediate data* and are *stateless*, and in particular the following stateful validations are **NOT** performed:
///
/// 1. The [difficulty_threshold](BcBlockHeader::difficulty_threshold) is within correct bounds for the Difficulty Adjustment Algorithm.
/// 2. The [time](BcBlockHeader::time) field is within correct bounds.
/// 3. The [merkle_root](BcBlockHeader::merkle_root) field is sensible.
///
/// No other validations are performed.
///
/// **TODO:** Ensure deserialization delegates to [BftPayload::try_from].
///
/// ## Design Notes
///
/// This *assumes* is is more natural to fetch the latest BC tip in Zebra, then to iterate to parent blocks, appending each to the [Vec]. This means the in-memory header order is *reversed from the specification* [^1]:
///
/// > Each bft‑proposal has, in addition to origbft‑proposal fields, a headers_bc field containing a sequence of exactly σ bc‑headers (zero‑indexed, deepest first).
///
/// The [TryFrom] impl performs internal validations and is the only way to construct a [BftPayload], whether locally generated or from an unknown source. This is the safest design, though potentially less efficient.
