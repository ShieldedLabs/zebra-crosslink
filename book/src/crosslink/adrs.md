# Crosslink Architecture Decision Records

We use an approach of documenting many design decisions during the implementation of `zebra-crosslink` via [Architecture Decision Records](https://adr.github.io/), inspired by their use in upstream `zebra`. These are especially important for our Prototype-then-Productionize approach, since they record key decisions we should review for production readiness.

Currently ADRs are very rough and tracked on this [zebra-crosslink ADR Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1X6dMxrkbWshhy8JwR7WkNC7JuN1J5YKNFzTcR-BolRo/edit?gid=0#gid=0).

Moving forward we will begin to incorporate them into this codebase.
