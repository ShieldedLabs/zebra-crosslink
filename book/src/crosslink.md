# Crosslink Functionality

This [zebra-crosslink](https://github.com/ShieldedLabs/zebra-crosslink) codebase is an in-progress implementation of the *Crosslink* hybrid Proof-of-Work / Proof-of-Stake consensus protocol described in [Zcash Trailing Finality Layer](https://electric-coin-company.github.io/tfl-book/).

**Status:** Early Prototype; see [Implementation Approach](#implementation-approach) below for definition.

## For Users

Presently, this implementation is not suitable for general users. There is no functioning testnet support. There is no guarantee Crosslink will activate on the Zcash network, although every indication we've seen is enthusiastic support from both the userbase and Zcash developer communities, so we expect it will be when the time is right.

## Implementation Approach

The high level roadmap has two main phases: _Prototyping Phase_ and _Productionization Phase_.

Please see the Shielded Labs Crosslink [Roadmap Timeline](https://shieldedlabs.net/roadmap/) for current status, and our [Blogpost](https://shieldedlabs.net/crosslink-roadmap-q1-2025/) for more detailed milestone plans.

## Design & Architecture

TBD. Stay tuned.
