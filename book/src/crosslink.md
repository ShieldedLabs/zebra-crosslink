# The Zebra Crosslink Implementation

This [zebra-crosslink](https://github.com/ShieldedLabs/zebra-crosslink) codebase is an in-progress implementation of the *Crosslink* hybrid Proof-of-Work / Proof-of-Stake consensus protocol described in [Zcash Trailing Finality Layer](https://electric-coin-company.github.io/tfl-book/).

We refer to the general protocol design as "Zcash Crosslink" and we call this implementation "the Zebra Crosslink Implementation" when we need to distinguish. Whenever this book refers to just "Crosslink" it's safer to assume we mean only this implementation which may have specifics, including flaws or bugs, which are not part of the general protocol design.

**Status:** Early Prototype; see [The Crosslink Roadmap](crosslink/roadmap.md).

## For Users

Presently, this implementation is not suitable for general users. There is no functioning testnet support. There is no guarantee Crosslink will activate on the Zcash network, although every indication we've seen is enthusiastic support from both the userbase and Zcash developer communities, so we expect it will be when the time is right.

## Design & Architecture

TBD. Stay tuned.
